# Weather Report Script
An informational reporting script that interacts with the Open Weather App API to provide current weather data and daily forecasts. This Python Script takes user-inputted locations (either cities or post codes) and utilizes the API's geocoding to return precise longitude and latitudes for the weather reports. It is intended for both everyday weather-checking usage or to aid with planning for upcoming trips, by returning daily weather forecasts for a specified range of dates within the next eight days. Script can be further altered to return daily forecasts for a longer range of dates with a professional API collection key.

## Prior to Running:
The api_key variable, set equal to an empty string (on line 13), needs to be replaced with a valid and active api key from Open Weather App Api. The api_key data type should remain a string and is required for the script to be run accurately. An api key can be obtained through free signup with Open Weather App Api at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up. 

## To Run:
This Python script can be run on any shell with python3 installed. Just clone the repository and run the script in a shell using "python weather-report.py" or "python3 weather-report.py".
